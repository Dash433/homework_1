### Horiseon

### What I did
* gave the work a title
* Created a header
* Changed a div into a nav element and gave the links different colors based on hover or focused
* Created a service class
* created a main element that held the 3 main content points
* within these main section was used to seperate each point
* Also a single class "service" was used instead of the repeated multiple ones that were used for these points
* created an aside
* in the aside a "benefits" class was used instead of the repeated ones
* created a footer
### What I could not do
* resize the image so that it did not overload the website
